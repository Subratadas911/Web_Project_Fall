            provided below.Operators of the National Emergency Service 999 have been trained to provide various types of calls and emergency services. All these
            agents get some technical support to provide accurate and quality service. However, when a citizen calls 999, it is important to keep the following in mind:
            

            1. Answering the question correctly: The operator or emergency service provider (in this case police, fire service, ambulance service providing authority) 
            will ask you some questions so that they can convey your need to the appropriate officer or authority. Or they can tell you about some life-saving tips or
            things to do. Assist the operator by providing correct answers to such questions. Of course you may have to answer the same question more than once to be 
            sure of your needs;This can happen especially if the call is transferred from 999 to the police or fire service or hospital.

            2.Be patient: Be calm during the call and explain your problem in detail. It is often seen that when a citizen goes to talk about his problem, he gets 
            emotional and talks unnecessarily. That should not be done. This allows the operator to catch the main problem And the real help is the difficulty. 
            Remember, the calmer you are, the more detailed your incident will be and the better the operator will be able to serve you.

            3.Keep the phone open: If you are calling from a mobile phone, keep your number open so that the operator can reconnect with you at any moment. 
            The police, fire service or ambulance authorities can also contact you according to your needs.

            4.Create awareness: 999 Emergency Services has a lot of children calling every day for no reason. As a result, the real victims are the victims.
            Teach your children how and when to call 999 with time and opportunity. Show me when you won't call.

            5.Every call is important: Every call is important whether it is a fall call or a prank call. Although these calls hinder the delivery of actual 
            emergency services. Legal action will be taken against the fake call and your number will be blocked. Keep your mobile locked so that 999 calls 
            do not go due to your negligence.
